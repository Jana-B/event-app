This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

This is an event platform app, following a youtube tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. A few minor changes (personal flair) have been given along the way. The purpose of this app is to deepen my knowledge of NextJS, revise TypeScript, try out more options with Clerk and learn about some new Libraries (ShadCn). This will also be the first app I host on Vercel. Package manager used: Yarn.
